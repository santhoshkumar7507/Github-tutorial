1) How do you clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine?
   - You can clone a repository by using the command `git clone <repository-url>` in your terminal. Make sure to replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone.    

2) The three important git commands are `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
   - `git add`: This command is used to stage changes in your working directory for the next commit. You can add specific files or use `git add .` to stage all changes.
   - `git commit`: This command is used to save your staged changes to the local repository. You should include a descriptive message with the `-m` flag, like `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.
   - `git push`: This command is used to upload your local commits to a remote repository on GitHub. You typically use it as `git push origin <branch-name>`, replacing `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to push to.
